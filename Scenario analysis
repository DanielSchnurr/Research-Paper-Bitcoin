How will Bitcoin develop in the future is the most exciting questions. The question cannot be answered, nevertheless it is useful to 
evaluate probabilities of several outcomes. For individuals which are interested in investing in Bitcoin this question is crucial. 
To start very simple the price of Bitcoin is driven by the mechanism of supply and demand. First the supply side will be analyzed 
because that is the easier part. 

The supply of Bitcoin is embedded into the code and cannot be changed. The total amount of Bitcoin is 21 000 000 BTC. Bitcoin is an 
inflationary currency whereas the level of inflation is declining with increasing amount of time. 2009 every 10 minutes 50 new BTC
have been mined though after 210 000 Blocks the amount of BTC mined per Block halved. That means 2013 every 10 minutes 25 new BTC are
created. This process will going on until the year 2140. This makes BTC theoretically the hardest money in the world. It should also be 
considered that some people have lost their private keys and will lose their private key in the future which restricts the amount 
of circulating BTC even more. If people lose their private key they are not able to spend their BTC.
